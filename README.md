# YouTube-Downloader
My terminal program for downloading videos and music from the YouTube platform

1. To download a video simply run "Solo Video Loader". As soon as the program finishes the video will be saved to the "video" folder as mp4.
2. To download only a sound of video just run "Solo Sound Loader". In the result the sound will be saved to the "sound" folder as mp3.
3. To download playlist run "Playlist Video Loader". As the proces finishes all available video will be saved in the playlist folder as mp4.
4. Finally to get only the sound of every videpo in the playlist just use "Playlist Sound Converter". This module will list every video in a "playlist" folder, take the audio and save it separately as an mp3.
